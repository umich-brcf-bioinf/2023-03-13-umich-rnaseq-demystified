## Aligning All Samples Exercise (Breakout):

<br>

**15 Minutes**

<br>

We just learned about how to use RSEM & STAR, but now we need to align all of the rest of our samples to the reference genome. In this breakout exercise, we'll build upon some concepts we've learned previously.

<br>

### Instructions:

<br>

- One group member should share their screen in the breakout room. If nobody volunteers, a helper may randomly select someone.
- The group members should discuss the exercise and work together to find a solution.
- After a solution is found, allow time for all members to complete the exercise.

<br>

- Review what we've learned about running RSEM + STAR, to determine an appropriate command for aligning our samples.
- Using what we've learned previously, create a script using this command to quickly and easily align the rest of our samples.
- Run the script, view the output, and verify that we have the files we need.
